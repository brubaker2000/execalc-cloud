# Execalc Cloud v1

Execalc is an executive-grade cognition platform designed to sit above large language models and govern their use through structured judgment, principled constraints, and auditable decision logic.

This repository is the canonical Cloud v1 trunk.

## Purpose
- Establish a governed, production-grade cloud foundation
- Enforce decision quality through explicit principles (value creation, asymmetry, risk discipline)
- Treat LLMs as substrates, not authorities
- Enable secure, multi-tenant executive cognition at enterprise scale

## Status
Cloud Version 1 — initial scaffold.
Architecture, protocols, and governance are locked prior to implementation.

## Non-Goals
- This is not an agent playground
- This is not prompt engineering
- This is not an experimentation sandbox

All additions to this repository must respect:
- Governance before capability
- Determinism before scale
- Auditability before speed
